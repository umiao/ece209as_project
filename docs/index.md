# Abstract

This 209AS project is about "Missing Data Imputation In Time Series".

Time series are all around in real world. However, unexpected events, such as broken sensors or missing signals, will result in missing values in time series, making the data difficult to be used and exploited. This also hurts the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation.
