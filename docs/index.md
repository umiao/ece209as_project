# Abstract

This 209AS project is about "Missing Data Imputation In Time Series".

Time series are all around in real-world applications. However, unexpected accidents for example broken sensors or missing of the signals will cause missing values in time series, making the data hard to be utilized. It then does harm to the downstream applications such as traditional classification or regression, sequential data integration and forecasting tasks, thus raising the demand for data imputation.
